# MULTIPLE-DISEASE-PREDICTION-Web-App-
Developed an interactive Web App which helps to predict 3 problems Diabetes, Heart and Parkinsans. In this, I have used Supervised learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression etc for Backend. and used StreamLit library for FrontEnd. We have to give input and based on input it predicts whether the person had some problem or not.
